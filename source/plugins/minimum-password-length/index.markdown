Minimum Password Length is a simple plugin that requires user passwords to
meet a predefined length requirement.

The default length is 7 characters.
To change this, simply edit the plugin file and change the value of $min_length
to the desired password length. This is, admittedly, a little clunky, but I
didn't think a single setting warranted a new settings page.
