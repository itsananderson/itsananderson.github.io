Comments that are too short often add little or nothing to a conversation.
The focus of "Short Comment Filter" is to automatically filter out comments that are too short.

Features
--------


* Filter by word or character count
* Set the minimum comment length
* Choose whether to delete or spam short comment
* Decide whether to filter comments made by registered users
* Use JavaScript to make sure comments meet the specified length requirements before being submitted
* Specify a custom message to show if the comment is too short (use %type% and %length% for dynamic messages)
