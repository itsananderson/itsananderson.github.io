This plugin is for developers.
It allows you to create "profiles" that store which plugins you have enabled and which theme you are using.

To set things up, enable the plugins and theme you want to save and go to Tools > Dev Profiles.
Enter a profile name and click "Create Profile" to create the new profile.

To enable an existing profile, go to the same page in Tools > Dev Profiles.
Select the your Dev Profile from the drop down menu (the theme and plugins contained in a profile will be displayed when it is selected).
Click "Enable Profile".
