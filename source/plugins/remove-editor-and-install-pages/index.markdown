**Update**: Check out a [much simpler solution](http://www.wpajax.com/articles/quick-tip-disallow-file-editing-on-client-dev-sites) by Ronald Huereca

Have you ever put up a WordPress demo site for a client, but been concerned about giving them admin access on your server? Remove Editor and Install Pages takes care of this by removing all access to theme and plugin editors and installers.

This is a MU (must use) plugin.
Place it in the `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder so that it cannot be disabled.
