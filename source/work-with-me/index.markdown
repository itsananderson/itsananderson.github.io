About Me
---

I'm a full-time software developer at Dropbox, but in my evenings and weekends I enjoy working on side projects. From my [open source work on GitHub](https://github.com/itsananderson?tab=repositories) to consulting projects, I'm almost always exploring something new and exciting. One of the reasons I enjoy consulting is that it brings me a steady stream of new challenges and problems to solve.

While I've worked on projects across a broad range of technologies, the following areas are where I have the most experience and passion.

Scalable APIs with Node and Docker
---

I love scalable systems, and I love JavaScript, so Docker and Node are two of my favorite tools for building scalable APIs.
If you need an API or a web application that can scale with your needs, I would love to help you achieve your goals!


WordPress Plugins and Auxiliary Services
---

I've been writing custom plugins and themes for WordPress since 2008.
My primary focus is on custom plugin development, but I've also delivered a number of complete web applications using WordPress as a CMS.

While I enjoy building websites and web apps with WordPress, I really get excited about projects that combine WordPress with other parts of the web.
This includes projects that harness the WordPress REST API, as well as projects that integrate WordPress with third-party services.
If you need to build a service that connects to WordPress, or you want to connect WordPress to an existing service, I would love to help you!
