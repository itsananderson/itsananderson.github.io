About Me
---

I'm a full-time software developer at Dropbox, but in my evenings and weekends I enjoy working on side projects. From my [open source work on GitHub](https://github.com/itsananderson?tab=repositories) to consulting projects, I'm almost always exploring something new and exciting. One of the reasons I enjoy consulting is that it brings me a steady stream of new challenges and problems to solve.

While I've worked on projects across a broad range of technologies, the following areas are where I have the most experience and passion.

Node.js APIs
---

My passion for web APIs extends beyond WordPress. If you're building a web API from scratch, Node.js is a great way to do it. Node's high-performance language design makes it quick and easy to build APIs that scale to thousands of users.

WordPress Plugins
---

I've been writing custom software for WordPress since 2008. My primary focus is on custom plugin development, but I've also delivered a number of complete web applications using WordPress as the platform.

In recent years, my focus has narrowed to the WordPress REST API. This is an exciting space, because it enables websites and mobile apps to connect to the enormous WordPress ecosystem.

How To Reach Me

If you're interested in building a web app or API with WordPress or Node, I'd be happy to talk to you about your project. Send me an [email](mailto:will@itsananderson.com) or get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsananderson).
