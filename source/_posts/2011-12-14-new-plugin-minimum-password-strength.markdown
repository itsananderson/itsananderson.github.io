A couple of years ago I released a plugin called
"[Minimum Password Length](/plugins/minimum-password-length/)".
It's been pretty popular, mostly thanks to some
[link love](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2009/08/23/wordpress-plugin-minimum-password-length/).
Ever since I released the plugin, I've been thinking "wouldn't it be nice to do something similar,
but harness the WordPress password strength meter?".
Well, I finally took the time to do that, and so we have the [Minimum Password Strength](/plugins/minimum-password-strength/) plugin.

This is also a special plugin, because it's the first one I've simultaneously published on GitHub and my site.
I plan on uploading my other plugins to GitHub at some point
(in fact, I uploaded [Short Comment Filter](/plugins/short-comment-filter/) a few days ago),
but Minimum Password Strength is the first one that's there from the start.
