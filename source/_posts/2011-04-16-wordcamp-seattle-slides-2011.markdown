Here are my WordCamp Seattle slides, along with my code samples.

The slides are available as a PDF [here](http://www.itsananderson.com/wcsea.pdf").

The WP_Ajax class is available as a zip file [here](http://www.itsananderson.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-ajax.zip").

The Simple Post Ratings plugin is available (also as a zip file) [here](http://www.itsananderson.com/wp-content/uploads/simple-post-ratings.zip).

Here's a link to my WordCamp Seattle video on [WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/2011/05/06/will-anderson-using-ajax-in-plugins-and-themes/).
