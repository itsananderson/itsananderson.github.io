I've decided I'm too familiar with the languages I use every day.
Well, I say that as if this is a recent realization.
I decided this about a year ago, and decided Clojure was the next language I should learn.

I did some initial research on the language, and found [a Clojure book](http://joyofclojure.com/) by an author I'd read before.
It had a second edition coming out soon, so I decided to pre-order that.

A year later, the book is finally on the way :)

It's good timing, though.
The last year has been a whirlwind.
I joined a new team at work, worked on 5-6 projects (literally lost count), and bought a house.
You know, the usual.

Things are finally settling down again a little, so what better time to take on another hobby?
