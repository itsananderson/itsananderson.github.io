I bought a new Wi-Fi router about a year ago, and I've been so happy with it that I decided to write a review.

The Goods
---------

Netgear has a truly impressive lineup of high-quality routers in their Nighthawk series.

When I purchased the Nighthawk R7000, it was the only Nighthawk available, but now there are three options.

### Nighthawk AC1900 (R7000)

This is the router I purchased.
At $176, it is now the cheapest one in the series, but don't let that fool you.
It's a beast.

### Nighthawk X4 AC2350 (R7500)

This model has an additional antena, a faster processor, and boasts improved range and faster bandwidth. It costs about $100 more than the R7000. This router uses a more advanced radio than the R7000 that apparently has higher throughput and reliability. That being said, I haven't yet had any complaiants about the throughput or reliability of the R7000.

### Nighthawk X6 AC3200 (R8000)

[![](http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/nighthawk-r8000.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWHMR6G?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B00KWHMR6G&linkCode=shr&tag=itsananderson-20&linkId=62Y4XCEYOOJRGP7I&f_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=15AA64WNHBH3N7C3AG2S&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2034761682&pf_rd_i=9524228011)

This model has 6 antenas, which again boosts range and bandwidth.
It also supports a third Wi-Fi band, and assigns slower and faster devices to different bands, boosting performance for fast devices.
This model is only about $5 more than the R7500 ($105 more than the R7000), so if I were to upgrade, this is the model I would choose, because of it's significantly improved bandwidth.

Price
-----

Here's a side-by-side comparison of the different models.

<table>
	<tr><th>Model</th><th>Price</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Nighthawk (R7000)</td><td>$176</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;Nighthawk X4 (R7500)</td><td>$279</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;Nighthawk X6 (R8000)</td><td>$283</td></tr>
</table>

When I first considered this router, the price was what gave me the most pause.
In the past, the most I'd paid for a router was about $40, so this seemed like a significant price bump.
In the end, the only reason I bought it was because a friend had bought one and was very happy with it.

After using it for a year, I don't think I'll ever buy a "cheap" router again.
In the case of Wi-Fi routers, it seems that "you get what you pay for" holds true.
