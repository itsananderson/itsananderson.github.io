I bought a new Wi-Fi router about a year ago, and I've been so happy with it that I decided to write a review.

The Goods
---------

Netgear has a truly impressive lineup of high-quality routers in their Nighthawk series.

When I purchased the Nighthawk R7000, it was the only Nighthawk available, but now there are three options.

### Nighthawk AC1900 (R7000)

This is the router I purchased.
At $176, it is now the cheapest one in the series, but don't let that fool you.
It's a beast.

### Nighthawk X4 AC2350 (R7500)

[![](http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/nighthawk-r7500.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MRVJY5C?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B00MRVJY5C&linkCode=shr&tag=itsananderson-20&linkId=VIPUHQZWDGEZTHRJ&f_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=15AA64WNHBH3N7C3AG2S&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2034761682&pf_rd_i=9524228011)

This model has an additional antena, a faster processor, and boasts improved range and faster bandwidth. It costs about $100 more than the R7000. This router uses a more advanced radio than the R7000 that apparently has higher throughput and reliability. That being said, I haven't experienced any problems with the throughput or reliability of the R7000.

### Nighthawk X6 AC3200 (R8000)

[![](http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/nighthawk-r8000.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWHMR6G?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B00KWHMR6G&linkCode=shr&tag=itsananderson-20&linkId=62Y4XCEYOOJRGP7I&f_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=15AA64WNHBH3N7C3AG2S&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2034761682&pf_rd_i=9524228011)

This model has 6 antenas, which again boosts range and bandwidth.
It also supports a third Wi-Fi band, and assigns slower and faster devices to different bands, boosting performance for fast devices.
This model is only about $5 more than the R7500 ($105 more than the R7000), so if I were to upgrade, this is the model I would choose, because of it's significantly improved bandwidth.

Price
-----

Here's a side-by-side comparison of the different models.

<table>
	<tr><th>Model</th><th>Price</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Nighthawk (R7000)</td><td>$176</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;Nighthawk X4 (R7500)</td><td>$279</td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;Nighthawk X6 (R8000)</td><td>$283</td></tr>
</table>

When I first considered this router, the price was what gave me the most pause.
In the past, the most I'd paid for a router was about $40, so this seemed like a significant price bump.
In the end, the only reason I bought it was because a friend had bought one and was very happy with it.

After using it for a year, I don't think I'll ever buy a "cheap" router again.
In the case of Wi-Fi routers, it seems that "you get what you pay for" holds true.

Reliability and Performance
-----------

My primary reason for upgrading my router was that my previous router, an older Linksys in the $30-40 range, didn't reliably reach the entire house.
After enough complaints from one roommate who's bedroom was in the far corner of the house, I decided to upgrade.

After installing the R7000, I've stopped having router issues.
The signal reaches to every corner of the house, and has never cut out.

I eventually even swapped out the Ethernet cables in my two desktop computers, replacing them with this [Dual Band Wireless PCI Express adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GMPZ0A?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B007GMPZ0A&linkCode=shr&tag=itsananderson-20&linkId=E3Z7SM7WKO2M3UVP&psc=1).
Even after getting rid of the hard line, I get blazing fast speeds on both machines.

Extra Features
------

### Mounting Slots

One of the things I took advantage of immediately was the slots on the back for mounting it on a wall.
Moving the router to a more central location in my downstairs hallway provided even better coverage throughout the house.

Pro tip: make sure there's a power outlet within easy reach of your desired location **before** you start screwing in drywall anchors :)

### Web-based WPS Button

Most routers support WPS. This allows new clients to connect to a network by clicking a physical button on the router.
This is convenient, but who wants to have to get up and walk over to the router.

Fortunately the Nighthawk web UI has a button you can push to do the same thing.

### Easy Firmware Upgrade

Most of my past routers have had a really archaic update process. Usually you have to manually flash the firmware and go through a convoluted restart process.

The R7000, on the other hand, just requires one or two clicks to install the update and automatically restart.

### And So Much More

I usually install DD-WRT on any router I buy, but the R7000 has all the features I typically use, so I'm just running the stock firmware.
Here are a few of the things I use most frequently:

* View attached devices
* Port forwarding
* Assign static LAN IPs
* View traffic statistics

In Conclusion
-------------

If you're tired of buying cheap routers that crap out after a year or two, I highly recommend the [Nighthawk R7000](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F0DD0I6?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B00F0DD0I6&linkCode=shr&tag=itsananderson-20&linkId=BOLZOX4JTJAYBWR2).
