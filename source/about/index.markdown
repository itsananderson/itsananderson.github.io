Hi, I’m Will Anderson. I’m a 2012 Computer Science grad from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/). I work in the Microsoft Developer Devision, building cloud services for app developers.


What do I do for work?
---


I love solving problems, and I enjoy developing software for the web. While in school, I did lots of freelance [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) plugin development. Now that I’m a full-time software developer, I work with all kinds of technology, but I still enjoy projects that involve WordPress, so I’ve continued doing it in my free time. If you’re looking for developers for a WordPress project, get in touch with myself and my coworkers at [CodeAwhile.com](http://codeawhile.com).


What do I do for fun?

I have a number of personal projects in various stages of completion on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsananderson?tab=repositories). I’ve also collaborated with my CodeAwhile coworkers on several projects, which you can find on our [organization GitHub page](https://github.com/CodeAwhile?tab=repositories).


When I’m not writing code, I enjoy a number of other hobbies. I’ve dabbled in RC airplanes, woodworking, and Arduino/IoT.
