<h2>Hmm, couldn't find what you're looking for</h2>

<p>I recently moved to a new website, and I may have broken something</p>

<p>If you got here because I goofed, <a href="https://github.com/itsananderson/itsananderson.github.io/issues/new">create an issue</a> with the broken URL and I'll fix it as soon as I can</p>

<script>
jQuery(function($) {
	//$.get("http://localhost:3000/found-404/?url=" + document.location);
	$.get("http://itsananderson-migrate.azurewebsites.net/found-404/?url=" + document.location);
});
</script>
