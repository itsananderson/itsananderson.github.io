    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m too familiar with the languages I use every day.
Well, I say that as if this is a recent realization.
I decided this about a year ago, and decided Clojure was the next language I should learn.</p>

<p>I did some initial research on the language, and found <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">a Clojure book</a> by an author I&rsquo;d read before.
It had a second edition coming out soon, so I decided to pre-order that.</p>

<p>A year later, the book is finally on the way :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good timing, though.
The last year has been a whirlwind.
I joined a new team at work, worked on 5-6 projects (literally lost count), and bought a house.
You know, the usual.</p>

<p>Things are finally settling down again a little, so what better time to take on another hobby?</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/06/02/ending-a-stream-without-consuming-its-data/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-02T10:28:46-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/06/02/ending-a-stream-without-consuming-its-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into an issue recently while writing <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/placebase">a node module</a>.
My process would sometimes complete its work, but wouldn&rsquo;t end.
After a bit of debugging, I figured out what was happening.</p>

<p>I had implemented a handler for the HTTP &ldquo;location&rdquo; header.
If a response came back with that header, I would ignore that response and go fetch the new location instead.
Unfortunately, whenever I did that, the process would finish fetching the new location, and then just hang there for about a minute bofore exiting.
The reason this happened was because I wasn&rsquo;t properly handling the first response.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an oversimplified explanation of what happens.
This is from my limited understanding of Node internals, so the details may be slighly off, but the overall idea is correct.</p>

<p>When you use the &ldquo;http&rdquo; module to make a request in Node, the response it gives you is a stream.
If you don&rsquo;t do anything to consume that stream&rsquo;s data, Node doesn&rsquo;t exit because there&rsquo;s still work to be done (consuming the stream).
In order to get Node to exit without something clunky like process.exit(), you just need to switch the stream to &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; mode.</p>

<p>Notice on line 6 how I&rsquo;ve called response.resume().
This switches the response stream to &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; mode.
According to the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_resume">streams documentation</a>,
this is the way to finish a stream if you don&rsquo;t care about consuming its data.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-22T18:25:22-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/22/escaping-exclamation-marks-in-bash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever committed to Git in either frustration or excitement, you&rsquo;ve probably seen a message like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;It works!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>-bash: !<span class="err">&quot;</span>: event not found
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When Bash encounters an exclamation mark under certain conditions, it tries to expand the expression to the last matching command in your history.
For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>Hello, World
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls
</span><span class='line'>bin  foo.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>!e
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>Hello, World
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>!l
</span><span class='line'>ls
</span><span class='line'>bin  foo.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the second command <code>!e</code> was expanded to the previous <code>echo "Hello, World"</code> statement, and <code>!l</code> is expanded to the previous <code>ls</code> statement.
This is cool, but can also be annoying if that&rsquo;s not what you want.
Fortunately there&rsquo;s a workaround.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># If you don&#39;t need variable substitution, use single quotes</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s1">&#39;It works!&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># If you need variable substitution, keep exclamation outside the quotes</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Thanks $name&quot;</span><span class="se">\!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Or escape with single quotes</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Thanks $name&quot;</span><span class="s1">&#39;!&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Also works in the middle of the line</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Thanks&quot;</span><span class="se">\!</span><span class="s2">&quot; $name&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As far as I can tell, these solutions work in both Linux, and Git Bash in Windows.</p>

<p>You can also work around this by leaving of the <code>-m</code> and editing your commit message in vim like a real developer

    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/14/live-compiling-aspnet-vnext-with-nodemon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something cool that Scott Hanselman talked about in his <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingASPNETVNext.aspx">blog post on vNext</a>
was the ability to save a C# file in Visual Studio and view the change in the browser without manually rebuilding.</p>

<p>After spending a little time messing around with the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet">newly released code</a>, I wanted similar functionality when editing C# files outside Visual Studio.
I didn&rsquo;t see a documented way to do that, but there&rsquo;s an easy workaround if you have Node installed.</p>

<p>First install the &ldquo;nodemon&rdquo; package.
This package monitors a directory for file chanages and respawns a child process whenever anything changes.</p>

<p><code>npm install -g nodemon</code></p>

<p>Now that nodemon is installed, you can use it to live-rerun your app.</p>

<p><code>nodemon --exec "K.cmd web" -e cs,json</code></p>

<p>This tells Nodemon to watch for changes to <em>.cs and </em>.json files and to restart &ldquo;K.cmd web&rdquo; when changes are detected.
Replace &ldquo;web&rdquo; with &ldquo;run&rdquo; or whatever startup command is configured for your project.</p>

<p>Note that if you&rsquo;re running in Git Bash on Windows (which I currently can&rsquo;t get working) or on a Linux/OSX machine, the &mdash;exec command will probably be either <code>K web</code> or <code>K.sh web</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/nodemon-k.png" alt="Live re-compiling with nodemon" /></p>

<p>This functionality is <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/22#issuecomment-43148021">on the way for ASP.NET vNext</a>, but for now this is a handy workaround.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft made some anouncements about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/05/12/the-next-generation-of-net-asp-net-vnext.aspx">next generation of ASP.NET today</a>.</p>

<p>David Fowler published a post about <a href="http://davidfowl.com/asp-net-vnext/">the reasoning behind some of the changes</a>.
Scott Hanselman published a post with more details about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingASPNETVNext.aspx">the features that are coming our way</a>.
There&rsquo;s a ton of stuff to be excited about here, but my favorite part is these two paragraphs from Scott&rsquo;s post (emphasis his).</p>

<blockquote><p>The project system is also changing &ndash; we&rsquo;re integrating packages.config, NuGet specifications (nuspec),
and project files (csprojs) into a unified view of your project dependencies expressed in a project.json file.</p>

<p>NuGet packages and class libraries are treated the same.
You get full intellisense in the project.json file and NuGet packages come down automatically and transparently.
Even better, let&rsquo;s say NuGet package Foo.Bar has a bug but you&rsquo;ve only got the NuGet package.
You can make a folder called Foo.Bar in our local project and put the source via &ldquo;git clone&rdquo; in that folder.
This is great for open source projects.
<strong>That local version overrides the NuGet, allowing you to easily patch bugs locally in libraries while you wait for a new release.</strong>
When a new fixed NuGet-distributed version shows up, update the version and delete the local source.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-12T10:57:58-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/12/git-concepts-branches-forks-and-pull-requests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My team recently started migrating our source control from TFVC to Git (yay!).
There&rsquo;s been some confusion about a few Git and DVCS related terms.
If you&rsquo;re also confused, don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re not the only one.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="385" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2vJNNAQZlg" allowfullscreen frameborder="0">
</iframe>


<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some basic Git concepts.</p>

<h2>Branches</h2>

<p>Branches are a core concept in Git.
Unlike centralized version control, branches in Git don&rsquo;t show up as folders in the file system.
Instead, your project folder only contains the contents of one branch, which you &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; into your working directory.</p>

<p>Internally, branches are basically a pointer to a commit, designed to move forward when new commits are created.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">this page on git branches</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Forks</h2>

<p>Forking is a concept that exists outside Git.
In the old days, forking an open source project meant splitting off from the original project, either to continue development or move in a different direction.</p>

<p>These days a fork is simply a feature of several open source code hosting websites.
If I want to introduce a change to an open source project, I obviously can&rsquo;t just edit the repository directly.
Instead, what I have to do is fork the repository, which creates a copy of that repository that belongs to me.
I can then modify that fork and, if desired, propose those changes back to the original repository.</p>

<p>GitHub has a pretty good <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">article on forking repositories</a>.
It also talks about creating pull requests.</p>

<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>One of the most easily misunderstood concepts in Git is the pull request.
Part of the reason for the confusion is that in most current pull request workflows, nobody ever &ldquo;pulls&rdquo; changes.
&ldquo;Merge request&rdquo; would be a more accurate term.</p>

<p>When you create a pull request on an open source project, you&rsquo;re usually asking that changes from a branch in your repository be merged with a branch on another repository.
In most cases, your repository is a fork of the other repository, and you&rsquo;re requesting to merge your changes into their master branch.</p>

<p>Pull requests can also be used as a code review workflow within a single repository.
I&rsquo;ve done this for some of my own open source projects.
It&rsquo;s really useful for teams who work together on a project.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not already doing your feature work in a branch, you should learn to <a href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/06/git-for-devs-who-cant-commit-good/">commit good</a>.
Once you&rsquo;re doing your work in a branch, pull requests are the next logical step.
As soon as you&rsquo;re at a point where you&rsquo;re not embarassed by your code, create a pull request.
You can continue pushing new changes to your branch for reviewers to see.
By starting the feedback loop as early as possible, your peers can help catch issues that you&rsquo;d otherwise have to spend a long time undoing.</p>

<p>The other thing pull requests for team projects enables is multiple collaborators.
Most other code review tools only belong to one person.
This is a hassle if two people have collaborated on a feature.
With pull requests, many collaborators can push to a single branch, and all changes can be reviewed as a single unit.</p>

<p>Once again, GitHub has a good <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">article on pull requests</a>.
This one is very specific to GitHub&rsquo;s pull request workflow.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/08/inspecting-git-traffic-in-fiddler/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-08T07:32:26-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/08/inspecting-git-traffic-in-fiddler</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you ever need to inspect Git traffic to diagnose problems, or are just curious about the internal workings of Git, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to make Git send traffic through Fiddler.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git config --global http.proxy 127.0.0.1:8888
</span><span class='line'>git config --global http.sslVerify false</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This tells Git to use Fiddler as the proxy, and to turn off SSL certificate verification (so it doesn&rsquo;t balk at Fiddler&rsquo;s cert).</p>

<p>Make sure Fiddler&rsquo;s actually running, or Git won&rsquo;t be able to connect.</p>

<p>If you just want to use Fiddler for a single repository, run the commands from within that repository without the <code>--global</code> flag. Obviously this work for the <code>git clone</code> command, so you&rsquo;ll have to use a global configuration if you want to inspect that.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, make sure you undo your changes:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git config --global --unset http.proxy
</span><span class='line'>git config --global --unset http.sslVerify</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, remove the <code>--global</code> flag if you&rsquo;re just inspecting traffic for a single repository.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/07/running-express-4-sites-on-azure/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-07T06:57:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/07/running-express-4-sites-on-azure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve created an Express 4 app with the new scaffold utility recently, you may have noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t work in Azure. When you try to load the site, it fails with the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Diagnosis</h2>

<p>This is because of the new structure Express creates for its apps. Instead of app.js being the expected entry point, Express now specifies bin/www as the entry point for starting the server.</p>

<p>I suspect the reason for this is so that the newly scaffolded app can be consumed as a module, allowing the consumer to worry about port binding etc. Unfortunately, this causes problems for Azure.</p>

<p>When Azure starts a Node.js site, it looks for either a server.js or an app.js. As far as I can tell from my admittedly limited testing, it doesn&rsquo;t seem look at package.json for an alternate entry point. Because of this, when it includes app.js, nothing ever binds to the listening port, so the app immediately exits on startup.</p>

<h2>The Workaround</h2>

<p>Since Azure first looks for a server.js file when it starts a site, the easiest solution I&rsquo;ve found is to add a <code>server.js</code> file with the following contents.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./bin/www&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, when Azure starts your site, it will require server.js, which will require bin/www, which will require app.js. After that somewhat convoluted redirection chain, all will again be right in the world.</p>

<p>The Azure documentation has an <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-nodejs-develop-deploy-express-app/">alternative workaround</a> (see steps 4 and 5 of &ldquo;Install Express&rdquo;), but I don&rsquo;t care for it.
The problem with their solution is that it duplicates the code from bin/www into server.js, which means any updates you make to bin/www will also need to be applied to server.js.
Long story short, code duplication sucks.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things that would properly solve this problem instead of just working around it.</p>

<h3>Express Scaffold Fix</h3>

<p>There are probably a few ways Express could fix this, but the simplest I can think of would be to add a server.js that does the same thing as my workaround.
If that&rsquo;s not desirable for all sites, they could add a &ldquo;Azure compatibility&rdquo; flag that explicitly adds the sever.js workaround.</p>

<h3>Azure Fix</h3>

<p>In my oppinion, Azure should have a way to specify the entry-point in package.json rather than hardcoding to app.js and server.js.</p>

<p>The conventional <code>npm start</code> configuration is a logical place to begin, since it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html">supported spec from npm</a>.</p>

<p>Azure relies on iisnode, which probably can&rsquo;t consume package.json directly.
However, Azure could look at a setting in package.json during the site setup process (when it does stuff like package restore), and configure web.config, just like it does now to switch between app.js and server.js.</p>

    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/06/git-for-devs-who-cant-commit-good</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two big Git mantras are &ldquo;Commit early, commit often&rdquo; and &ldquo;Branches are cheap&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When I started using Git, I had these ideas in the back of my mind.
Unfortunately, I only really thought of them after I&rsquo;d done a huge chunk of work without committing any code.
I&rsquo;d type <code>git status</code> or <code>git diff</code> and scroll through my changes, but I&rsquo;d eventually admit defeat and commit everything.
I&rsquo;d promise to commit more frequently &ldquo;next time&rdquo;, but it never seemed to happen.</p>

<p>Frequent committing is something that you learn as a way to avoid pain.
In a typical chunk of dev time, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to make a sweeping change, and then realize that the change was a bad decision.
Without commit history, the only way to get back the previous version is to rely on your editor&rsquo;s undo function.
This causes problems when you have a mix of changes that you want to keep and changes that you want to undo.
Frequent, small commits can make it easier to jump pack to specific points.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/commit-for-ants.jpg"></p>

<h2>Creating Good Commits</h2>

<p>In addition to committing frequently, it&rsquo;s important to make good commits.
There are several important features aspects in a good commit.</p>

<h3>Good Commit Messages</h3>

<p>Writing a good commit message takes more than avoiding &ldquo;did stuff&rdquo; messages.</p>

<p>A good commit message is a love note to your future self, or anyone else who works on your code.
A bad commit message is more of a suicide note.</p>

<p>A technique I picked up from <a href="http://davidruttka.com/">David</a>, one of my coworkers, is to do commit messages along the lines of the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;short summary of changes in imperative voice&gt;

&lt;longer paragraph describing the change&gt;

Fixes/Implements: #&lt;issue or feature number&gt;

Before:
&lt;description of problem you are fixing or feature you are implementing&gt;

After:
&lt;how it behaves now that your change is applied&gt;

How I Tested It:
&lt;description of any unit tests, functional tests, or manual tests you ran to test this change&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This may seem verbose, but it really doesn&rsquo;t take long, and it gives you a huge advantage if you ever have to come back and figure out what this commit was all about.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t apply to every change.
If you&rsquo;re fixing a typo in a comment, or adding a missing semicolon to your JavaScript, you can probably get away with a one line commit message.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that a competent dev should be able to look at your commit message and (approximately) duplicate your work without looking at the code.</p>

<p>Finally, your summary line should be written in imperative voice.
&ldquo;Make changes&rdquo; not &ldquo;Made changes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Making changes&rdquo;.
This guarantees that your messages will mesh with Git&rsquo;s auto-generated messages for things like <code>revert</code> and <code>merge</code>.
It also makes it clear that you&rsquo;re talking about what this commit does, not what previous or future commits are doing.</p>

<p>For more thoughts on commit messages, see <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">A Note About Git Commit Messages</a>.</p>

<h3>The Right Files</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to use a <code>-a</code> flag to commit all pending changes, but in most cases you should put more thought into what files you include in a commit.</p>

<p>Consider an example.
Say you add a feature in file <code>a.js</code>, but in the process, you discover a typo in <code>b.js</code>.
It&rsquo;s tempting to commit both changes as one, because the typo fix is so small, but consider what happens if you later need to revert your commit.
Not only will you be reverting your feature, but you&rsquo;ll also be reverting the typo fix. This means you&rsquo;ll need to do a second commit to re-fix the typo change.
If you instead do two distinct commits, you can safely undo the problematic feature without touching the typo fix.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to add each file individually.
There are many handy shortcuts for adding exactly the files you intend.</p>

<p><code>git add file1 file2 file3</code> &ndash; Adds multiple files in one command</p>

<p><code>git add folder/</code> &ndash; Adds all changes under a folder</p>

<p><code>git add .</code> &ndash; Stages all modified and new files in the current folder</p>

<p><code>git add -A .</code> &ndash; Stages all modifed and new files as well as staging any deleted files in the current folder</p>

<p><code>git add '*.txt'</code> &ndash; Recursively adds all files ending in .txt</p>

<p><code>git add *.txt</code> &ndash; Adds all files <em>in the current folder</em> ending in .txt</p>

<p>This approach doesn&rsquo;t just apply to different files.
What if you add a feature and fix a typo in the same file?<br/>
Fortunately, <code>git add -p</code> makes it easy to <a href="http://www.benhallbenhall.com/2013/01/git-add-p-patches-full-commits/">only stage parts of files</a>.</p>

<p>If you &ldquo;add&rdquo; (or stage) a file that you don&rsquo;t want to commit, it&rsquo;s easy to remove.
Just run <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Using these techniques, you can create concise, cohesive, good looking commits.
Your future self will thank you.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/good-looking-commits.jpg"></p>

<h2>Learning to Do Other Stuff Good Too</h2>

<p>There are a number of other techniques for creating a useful commit history.
Here are some that I&rsquo;ve found especially useful.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Only use these techniques if you haven&rsquo;t shared your changes.
If you&rsquo;ve already pushed your changes, ammending your commit can cause problems for other collaborators on your project</p>

<h3>Fixing a Commit</h3>

<p>One of the great features of Git is the ability to rewrite history.
The simplest way to do that is with the <code>git commit --amend</code> command.
This will take your current staged changes and apply them to the previous commit, &ldquo;ammending&rdquo; it.
You&rsquo;ll also get a chance to change the commit message.</p>

<p>This is useful for in a number of cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>You make a commit and forgot to add a file</li>
<li>You missed adding a part of a file</li>
<li>You had a typo in one of your changes</li>
<li>You had a typo, or missing information in your commit message</li>
</ul>


<h3>Squashing Commits</h3>

<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have silly commits like &ldquo;forgot a file&rdquo;, and you don&rsquo;t need them to be distinct.
For the sake of your commit history, it can be good to flatten those commits.
This allows you to pretend that you never make any mistakes :)</p>

<p>Consider the following log</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>8fb97b5 Implement bla bla 
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>bb0ee77 Address feedback
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>bf582d6 Implement foo foo
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If your changes from <code>Address feedback</code> are just cleanups to <code>Implement foo foo</code>, you probably don&rsquo;t need that extra commit sitting in your commit history.</p>

<p>I could walk through the process of rebasing, but there&rsquo;s already a pretty thorough tutorial on <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">squashing commits with rebase</a></p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Making throughful, atomic, thoroughly commented commits takes some practice, but it&rsquo;s totally worth it.</p>

<p>In the next couple weeks, I plan to write some follow-up posts that cover other techniques for managing your commit history.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-08T08:10:41-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/04/08/a-lesson-in-debugging-verify-your-tools</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a cautionary tale</p>

<p>Yesterday I wasted a day of dev time.
Worse than that, I was pairing with <a href="http://www.davidruttka.com/">two</a> of my <a href="http://msarchet.com/">co-workers</a> most of the day, so in the end we wasted about 2.5 days of dev time.</p>

<p>We spent the day debugging an &ldquo;off by one (and sometimes two)&rdquo; error.</p>

<p>David, one of my coworkers, <a href="http://www.davidruttka.com/blog/2014/04/09/principles-of-debugging-a-postmortem/">also blogged this experience</a>.
It&rsquo;s an entertaining read.
Check it out.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The bug seemed simple.
They always do.
When you requested something by Id from our API, it returned with almost valid data.
Except that the Id property in the JSON (a long) was frequently incremented or decremented by 1 or 2.</p>

<p>We originally saw the issue in an Angular app.
We were suspicious about potential JavaScript numeric issues, so of course we opened up Fiddler to get at the &ldquo;real&rdquo; data</p>

<h2>The Fiddler Inspection</h2>

<p>When we inspected the requests in Fiddler and looked at the JSON viewer, same &ldquo;off by [1-2]&rdquo; issue.
In our minds, this confirmed that Angular and JavaScript weren&rsquo;t the issue.</p>

<p>After going through the &ldquo;disable stuff until it works&rdquo; process with our API, we were still seeing the same problem.
The only thing that fixed the issue was having Fiddler request XML instead of JSON. &ldquo;Ahh&rdquo;, we thought, &ldquo;The issue must be with our JSON serializer&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Checking the Serializer</h2>

<p>We spent a few minutes in LINQPad performing serializations with Json.NET, duplicating the problematic object as closely as possible.
The object serialized without issue, which confirmed in our minds that Json.NET does not, in fact, mangle long values during serialization</p>

<h2>The Reduction</h2>

<p>We decided to build a reduction by creating an empty WebApi project and adding components until we reproduced the issue.
We added a dummy controller that returns an object identical to the one with the serialization issues.
We opened the new URL in the browser, and the serialization issues weren&rsquo;t there.
We should have checked the reduction in Fiddler, but we didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Patterns Emerge</h2>

<p>Early on in our debugging session, I noticed that even Ids either remained unchanged or incremented/decremented by two.
Odd Ids, on the other hand, always either incremented or decremented by one.</p>

<p>I initially identified a simplified version of that pattern where even Ids don&rsquo;t change, so when counter-examples emerged, I abandoned the search for a pattern.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, we decided to generate a consecutive sequence of Ids to see if we could identify a pattern.
What we discovered is that for large Ids, the numbers began &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; to multiples of four.
Small Ids (like, say, 207) didn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<h2>The Final Puzzle Piece</h2>

<p>While David spun a series of object serializations through LINQPad, I began combining keywords in Bing to see if I could find anyone else with the same issue.</p>

<p>Around the time David realized that LINQPad was spitting out serialized Ids with correct values, I discovered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6571339/how-to-correctly-serialize-c-sharp-long-number-using-controllers-json-method-in">this StackOverflow post on &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; serializing longs</a>.
As the answer explains, JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t have longs.
All numbers are 64 bit floats.
We&rsquo;d considered this, but had dismissed it because Fiddler was showing the same issue.</p>

<p>Then it hit me.
Fiddler is written in JScript, which means it has the same 64 bit float limitations.</p>

<p>By implicitly trusting Fiddler&rsquo;s JSON viewer, we assumed the problem was incorrect data coming from our server.
When we finally looked at the raw data in Fiddler, we saw that the correct Ids were coming across the wire.
Fiddler&rsquo;s JSON viewer was parsing the long into a 64 bit float and tossing away the last 2 bits, which effectively &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; all Ids to multiples of 4.</p>

<p>The problem wasn&rsquo;t with our API directly.
The problem was the way JavaScript and JScript handle large numbers.</p>

<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>

<p>When debugging an issue like this, look at the raw data.
Not some data viewer over the data.
The <em>raw</em> data</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/04/07/understanding-vim-command-line-and-search-history/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-07T22:48:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/04/07/understanding-vim-command-line-and-search-history</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a Vim user like me, you&rsquo;ve likely found yourself staring at a view like this and wondered:</p>

<h4>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d I get here, and how do I get away&rdquo;</h4>

<p><img src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/vim-command-line-history.png"></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t dispair. You&rsquo;ve discovered Vim&rsquo;s command line history. This is the list of commands you&rsquo;ve run. They&rsquo;re stored in <code>~/.viminfo</code> or <code>~/_viminfo</code>, depending on your system configuration</p>

<p>There are actually two modes you can get into:
Command Line History, and Search History.
We&rsquo;ll cover both</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t want to get into your command/search history, you can easily get back to normal mode by hitting <code>CTRL+C</code> twice</p>

<h2>Command Line History</h2>

<p>Command line history is activated by typing <code>q:</code>. I usually find myself in this mode after trying to type <code>:q</code> too quickly</p>

<p>This is actually a pretty useful tool.
You&rsquo;re basically opening a file that contains your command history, so you can treat it like you would a file you have opened in Vim.</p>

<p>Start by navigating through the commands.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to move down and up.</li>
<li>You can search through the commands with <code>/&lt;searchtext&gt;</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Once you find the command you want to run, simply hit <code>ENTER</code> from &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; mode to run that command on the current file</p>

<h2>Search History</h2>

<p>Search history is activated by typing <code>q/</code>.</p>

<p>This is also a useful tool, though not as useful as command line history, in my opinion</p>

<p>Just like command line history, you can navigate through the history just like a regular file, and hit <code>ENTER</code> with the cursor over the desired search to perform that search on the current document</p>

<h2>Now You&rsquo;re Better at Vim</h2>

<p>When I figured out what these views meant, it took a scary &ldquo;how do I get out of this mode&rdquo; moment, and turned it into a &ldquo;this is useful&rdquo; moment.
Hopefully after reading this post, you&rsquo;ll feel the same way!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Node doesn&rsquo;t have a well documented way of checking whether a module is available.
This is usually fine. You just include a package.json in your project, and expect people to run <code>npm install</code>.
This is how most popular Node frameworks work.</p>

<p>But what if you have a devDependency entry that you want to include only if it is installed?
I searched for an answer and didn&rsquo;t find anything conclusive, so I&rsquo;m documenting what I <em>did</em> find in case I forget later.</p>

<p>Buried in NPM&rsquo;s package.json documentation is <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html#optionalDependencies">an example</a>
for handling a package that may or may not be installed. In short, you use a try/catch. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

I found that they have a pretty customized argument parser, which seems to make passing a HashSet pretty much impossible.
(If I&rsquo;m wrong, leave a comment!)</p>

<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a <em>fairly</em> reasonable workaround: Pass an array of arguments rather than a HashSet:</p>

<p>So there you have it. Use a list of parameter names and values rather than a HashSet when dynamically invoking NuGet.
This is actually somewhat intuitive from a classic CMD standpoint, but not so much from a PowerShell perspective.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2013/10/09/creating-an-angular-markdown-preview/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-09T17:56:26-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2013/10/09/creating-an-angular-markdown-preview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring <a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="Angular Project Homepage">Angular</a> over the last few months, and I really like the way it works.</p>

<p>Because I like to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> for things like my dev journal, I have been wanting to implement my own Markdown preview tool that I could customize to work just the way I want. When I first started learning Angular, I decided to see how easy it would be to write an Angular Markdown preview tool using Angular. Turns out it&rsquo;s super simple.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d rather skip straight to the demo, you can <a href="http://itsananderson.azurewebsites.net/markdown">view the finished markdown preview</a>.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into great detail about the purpose of Angular, since it&rsquo;s readily available elsewhere. In this project, I just wanted a simple way to bind to a textbox so that I could update an HTML Markdown preview. Angular&rsquo;s declarative binding makes it an excellent choice for this.</p>

<h3>Rendering an Angular Markdown Preview</h3>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t want to write my own markdown converter, I decided to look for an existing one. I quickly settled on this <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/markdown">markdown npm package</a>. I installed the package, then moved the converter code into my &lsquo;lib/js&rsquo; folder so that it would be accessible from my web app.</p>

<p>To make the front-end as simple as possible, I decided to <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.templates.filters.creating_filters">create an Angular filter</a> to provide the conversion from Markdown to HTML.</p>

<p>The code is pretty simple. The markdown npm package adds a &ldquo;markdown&rdquo; object to the &ldquo;window&rdquo; global, so it&rsquo;s easy to access the converter.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 4/25/14: In newer versions of Angular you&rsquo;ll need to include <code>angular-sanitize.js</code> on the page, and bind with the <code>ng-bind-html</code> attribute.

    <updated>2011-12-15T22:21:44-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2011/12/15/configuring-github-on-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a Windows developer like me, you&rsquo;ve probably had trouble working with GitHub on Windows. Here&rsquo;s what I did. Hopefully this will be helpful to you.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>First you need to grab a copy of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">Git for Windows</a>.
Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the latest version, launch it and go through the license and location screens.
Once you get to the &ldquo;Select Components&rdquo; screen, make sure both Context menu entries are selected.
If you want, select the TrueType font option.
That one shouldn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1130 aligncenter" title="select-components" alt="" src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/select-components.png" width="539" height="428" /></p>

<p>Jump ahead a few more frames and you&rsquo;ll get to the SSH executable option.
Choose &ldquo;OpenSSH&rdquo;, unless you have a compelling reason to use Plink.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1131" title="openssh" alt="" src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/openssh.png" width="546" height="432" /></p>

<p>Run through the rest of the frames, accepting the defaults.
You now have Git installed on your machine, but we&rsquo;re not quite done yet.
GitHub uses public/private key encryption.
This means you don&rsquo;t commit with a username and password, like most SVN setups.
Instead, you tell GitHub your public key, then use your private key to authenticate.</p>

<h2>Generating a Public Key</h2>

<p>GitHub has a detailed article on setting up your SSH keys on Mac/Windows/Linux.
I recommend <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">checking it out</a>.</p>

<h2>Clone a Repository From GitHub</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re just about there.
Go to your GitHub repository and select and copy the text in the textbox near the top of the page.
Make sure SSH is selected.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1135" title="github-url" alt="" src="http://willi.am/images/post-images/github-url.png" width="664" height="33" /></p>

<p>Open up Git Bash.
You should be able to find it in your start menu.
&ldquo;cd&rdquo; to the directory where you plan on checking out your code.
For example, if you want your code to be located in C:\programming\project then you want to &ldquo;cd&rdquo; to C:\programming.</p>

<p>Type out &ldquo;git clone &rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t hit enter yet.
Go to the top left corner of the Git Bash window and click.
In the menu that pops up, select Edit &ndash;> Paste to paste the URL of your repository, but still don&rsquo;t hit enter.
Finally, type the name you want to call the project folder.
In our example, you&rsquo;d want something like this:</p>

<p><code>git clone git@github.com:itsananderson/wp-sendgrid.git project</code></p>

<p>Now you can hit enter :)</p>

<p>If you entered a passphrase for your private key, it will ask you for it.
If all goes well, your repository should be downloaded.</p>

<h2>Some Sample Commands</h2>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a tutorial on Git commands, but here are a few to get you started:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>git status
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Add a file (new or modified, it doesn&#39;t matter. You need to add it to commit it)</span>
</span><span class='line'>git add file.php
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Add several files:</span>
</span><span class='line'>git add *.php
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Commit your changes locally (just stores a local snapshot of your changes):  </span>
</span><span class='line'>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Your commit message here&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Push your changes up to GitHub:</span>
</span><span class='line'>git push -u origin master
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Pull down updates from GitHub:</span>
</span><span class='line'>git pull
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s about it.
There&rsquo;s more to Git (which I&rsquo;m still learning about), but this should hopefully be enough to help you get started.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[New Plugin WP SendGrid]]></title>
    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2011/12/15/new-plugin-wp-sendgrid/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-15T08:49:43-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2011/12/15/new-plugin-wp-sendgrid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to attend an <a href="http://www.apihackday.com/">API Hackday</a> event in Bloomington.
At the event, I created some cool WordPress tools using <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, but I ended up having some free time
(because Twilio&rsquo;s API is so easy to use!), so I wrote another plugin called <a href="http://www.itsananderson.com/plugins/wp-sendgrid/">WP SendGrid</a> using the SendGrid API.</p>

<p>This plugin extends WordPress&#8217; <code>wp_mail()</code> function to use SendGrid&rsquo;s API for all emails.
This was useful to me because I&rsquo;ve never been able to figure out how to get PHP to send emails in Windows.
In the past, when I&rsquo;ve worked on projects that send emails, I always had to upload it to a Linux server to test the email functionality.
If anything didn&rsquo;t work, I had to edit locally, then upload again to test it.
After a few iterations, that gets really old.
With WP SendGrid, I can send emails from my local machine, so debugging issues is <strong>much</strong> easier.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a few months.
This week I decided to spend a little more time polishing the plugin.
I&rsquo;d only spent about 45 minutes on it at the HackDay, which shows how simple it is to use SendGrid&rsquo;s API.
What I put together was enough to meet my needs, but I was using hardcoded values, and wasn&rsquo;t considering every edge-case.
After a few more hours of work, I had a complete plugin with a nice configuration UI.</p>

<p>If you develop for WordPress on Windows, or you have trouble sending email from PHP on another platform, you&rsquo;ll want to check this plugin out.
<a href="http://www.itsananderson.com/plugins/wp-sendgrid/">Visit the plugin page</a>.</p>

<p>If you run into any issues, let me know by submitting a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/codeawhile/wp-sendgrid">GitHub</a> project.</p>

    <updated>2011-12-14T14:09:34-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2011/12/14/new-plugin-minimum-password-strength</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago I released a plugin called
&ldquo;<a href="http://willi.am/plugins/minimum-password-length/">Minimum Password Length</a>&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s been pretty popular, mostly thanks to some
<a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2009/08/23/wordpress-plugin-minimum-password-length/">link love</a>.
Ever since I released the plugin, I&rsquo;ve been thinking &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to do something similar,
but harness the WordPress password strength meter?&rdquo;.
Well, I finally took the time to do that, and so we have the <a href="http://willi.am/plugins/minimum-password-strength/">Minimum Password Strength</a> plugin.</p>

<p>This is also a special plugin, because it&rsquo;s the first one I&rsquo;ve simultaneously published on GitHub and my site.
I plan on uploading my other plugins to GitHub at some point
(in fact, I uploaded <a href="http://willi.am/plugins/short-comment-filter/">Short Comment Filter</a> a few days ago),
but Minimum Password Strength is the first one that&rsquo;s there from the start.</p>

    <updated>2011-11-29T11:50:03-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2011/11/29/creating-a-custom-chrome-search-engine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Custom search engines in Chrome are a pretty cool feature.
For example, <a href="http://jetheis.com/blog/2011/11/28/accelerating-rose-hulman-schedule-lookup-with-google-chrome/">Jimmy Theis has a great blog post</a>
about using them to look up someone&rsquo;s Rose-Hulman class schedule. The one shortcoming I&rsquo;ve found is that you can&rsquo;t do any processing of the actual search term.
In other words, you have to blindly jump to the search engine URL without evaluating the actual query.</p>

<p>In the case of the Rose-Hulman lookup page, there are actually two parameters that it would be nice to query on.
The first is the username of the person you&rsquo;re looking up, and the second is which quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer) to show.
With Chrome&rsquo;s custom search engines, you can&rsquo;t specify multiple parameters, so you have to hardcode the quarter parameter (which is hardly convenient).
To resolve this problem, I wrote a simple PHP script that takes in the search a search query (like <code>anderswc 1</code> or <code>jetheis 201130</code>) and translates it to the correct schedule lookup page query (my fall schedule, or Jimmy&rsquo;s spring schedule last year).
Here&rsquo;s the script:</p>

<p>Now you can create a custom search engine to point to this script (I&rsquo;ve got a copy running at <a href="http://itsananderson.com/schedule.php">http://itsananderson.com/schedule.php</a>), and specify &ldquo;?search=%s&rdquo;.
For example, this is the custom search engine definition I have:</p>

<p><code>http://itsananderson.com/schedule.php?search=%s</code></p>

<p>Search syntax is pretty simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;&lt;username>&rdquo; to look up a user&rsquo;s current schedule.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lt;username> &lt;quarter>&rdquo; to look up a user&rsquo;s schedule for a specific quarter this year.<br/>
Specify quarters as either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 10, 20, 30, 40</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lt;username> &lt;year>&lt;quarter>&rdquo; to look up a user&rsquo;s schedule for a specific quarter and academic year.<br/>
Quarters must be formatted with a trailing zero. Example: 201220 is Winter quarter, 2011-2012</li>
</ul>
