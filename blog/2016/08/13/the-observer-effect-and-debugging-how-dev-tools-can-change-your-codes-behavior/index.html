In general, this is very useful.
You can check the value of a variable, or even look at the results of more complex expressions. This is super useful, but it can also cause problems if you&rsquo;re not careful about how you use it. First, a little physics.
The Observer effect refers to &ldquo;changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed&rdquo;.
That definition precisely describes the behavior of this Chrome DevTools feature. Consider the following example where I highlight a call to a function that has a side effect (incrementing the variable i).
Whenever I hover over the code, it re-runs that expression, and the value of i increases. This side effect is fairly benign and easy to detect, but imagine a more complex function with multiple dependencies and obscured side-effects.
Worse, you could observe the value of a Proxy object without even knowing it might have side effects. Obviously this also serves as a warning against side effects in proxy handlers, but the point here is that these previews can affect the behavior of your code in significant ways. Several years ago, I wrote about verifying your tools after a Fiddler visualizer made a debugging session take much longer than it should have taken.
The same principal holds true here.

		<p>Chrome recently added a new feature to their JavaScript debugger where when you select a piece of code and hover over it, the code is evaluated and displayed in a little popover.
In general, this is very useful.
You can check the value of a variable, or even look at the results of more complex expressions.</p>

<p>First, a little physics.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)">Observer effect</a> refers to &ldquo;changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed&rdquo;.
That definition precisely describes the behavior of this Chrome DevTools feature.</p>

<p>Consider the following example where I highlight a call to a function that has a side effect (incrementing the variable <code>i</code>).
Whenever I hover over the code, it re-runs that expression, and the value of <code>i</code> increases.</p>
