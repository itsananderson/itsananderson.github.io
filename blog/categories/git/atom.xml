    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>Over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve been learning about woodworking in my spare time. As I&rsquo;ve read articles and watched YouTube videos, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the most successful woodworkers have a detailed knowledge of their tools. Not only do they know how to use and maintain the tools of their craft, but they&rsquo;re not afraid to modify them to better serve their needs. When they need a custom tool or jig to speed up their work, they make one. Watching and reading about these craftsmen and their tools, I&rsquo;ve noticed parallels in my full time craft: Software Development.</p></p><p><p>In the next few posts, I&rsquo;ll share some of the software &ldquo;jigs&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve created to make myself more efficient. The primary focus posts will be configuration and customization of Git.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Git Log: Your Own Personal Journal</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not already aware, your Git log is a critical tool for working with source control.
Because your memory&rsquo;s not perfect, a good log helps you recall what you&rsquo;ve done, and the motivation behind it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/06/git-for-devs-who-cant-commit-good/">written before</a> about writing good commit messages, as has David in his series <a href="http://www.davidruttka.com/blog/2014/06/04/committed-to-good-commits-messages/">&ldquo;Committed to Good Commits&rdquo;</a>.
If your commit logs are sprinkled with gems like &ldquo;did stuff&rdquo; and &ldquo;it finally works!&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll want to check out those posts.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Details With <code>--format</code></h2>

<p>Depending on what you&rsquo;re looking for in your log, you may want different levels of detail.
The Git log documentation has a <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html#_pretty_formats">full list of the built-in formats</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re trying to find the SHA for a recent change, you may just want to see the SHA and the commit subject for each commit.
In that case, <code>git log --format=oneline</code> or <code>git log --oneline</code> is what you need.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-oneline.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-oneline.png</a>"></p>

<p>If you need verbose output, including the full message and author info, <code>--format=medium</code> is a good option.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-medium.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-medium.png</a>"></p>

<p>Finally, if you want every single detail from the commit, <code>--format=fuller</code> will give you that.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-fuller.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-fuller.png</a>"></p>

<p>If you want to make any of these formats your default, you can do so with the following command:</p>

<p><code>bash
git config --global format.pretty oneline # replace oneline with the format you want
</code></p>

<h2>Limit Results With <code>-n</code></h2>

<p>If you only want to see the last few commits, you can use the <code>-n</code> flag.
The more verbose version is <code>-n &lt;number&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>-n 5</code> to show the last 5 commits).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use an even quicker shortcut.
Just use <code>-&lt;number&gt;</code>. For example: <code>git log -5</code> will show the last 5 commits.</p>

<h2>Fully Customize Your Log Output</h2>

<p>Depending on how you use your commit log, you may find that no built-in log format exactly fits your needs.
What I&rsquo;ve found is that the verbose formats are too hard to scan through, and the succinct ones don&rsquo;t have vital info.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I created a custom log format, which I use almost exclusively.</p>

<p>You can configure my format with the following command:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git config &mdash;global format.pretty format:&ldquo;%C(auto)%h %d%Creset %s%n%Cgreen%ad%Creset %aN &lt;%aE>%n&rdquo;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-custom.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-custom.png</a>"></p>

<p>This format also works with the <code>--graph</code> flag:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-graph-format.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-graph-format.png</a>"></p>

<p>What I like about this format is that it only uses three lines per commit, but it has all the information I care about.
I also inserted color codes for the various parts of the message, which makes it even easier to grok.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully these examples give you some ideas about what you can do to customize your commit log.
Don&rsquo;t feel like you need to use my custom log format as-is.
The whole point is to customize it to fit your needs.</p>

<p>If you want to test out different custom formats quickly, you can pass them directly to <code>git log</code> like so:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git log &mdash;format=format:&ldquo;%C(auto)%h %C(green)%aN%Creset %s&rdquo;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-custom-flag.png">http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/git-log-custom-flag.png</a>"></p>

<p>You can find the different placeholder options in the same <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html#_pretty_formats">Pretty Formats</a> section of the Git Log documentation.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/10/14/unpacking-a-git-database/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-14T13:57:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/10/14/unpacking-a-git-database</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While writing the <a href="/blog/2014/10/14/for-the-last-time-git-stores-snapshots-not-diffs/">previous post</a>, I discovered a cool Git command which I thought I&rsquo;d share.</p>

<p>When you clone a Git repository, most Git hosts will send you a packed version of the database.
This is much more efficient than sending the raw Git objects, because duplicate content can be compressed.</p>

<p>However, if you want to inspect the object database with a file browser, it&rsquo;s hard to do so, because the content stays packed in a single file.
Unpacking is pretty simple.</p>

<p>If you unpack the <code>.pack</code> file while it&rsquo;s in the <code>.git/object/pack</code> folder, Git won&rsquo;t do anything, because it concludes that it already has all the objects contained in that <code>.pack</code>.
However, if you move the <code>.pack</code> file somewhere else, you can unpack it into your repository&rsquo;s database.</p>

<p><code>
mv .git/object/pack/pack-*.pack .
cat pack-*.pack | git unpack-objects
rm pack-*.pack
</code></p>

<p>And there you have it.
Your packed objects are unpacked into <code>.git/objects/</code> folder.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t something I recommend doing as a general practice, since it can take up significantly more space, but it&rsquo;s a useful thing to be able to do if you want to manually inspect your Git database.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/10/14/for-the-last-time-git-stores-snapshots-not-diffs/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-14T10:15:11-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/10/14/for-the-last-time-git-stores-snapshots-not-diffs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have this discussion every month or two, so it&rsquo;s finally time to write a blog post I can point people to instead.
<strong>Git stores a snapshot of the entire file, not a diff</strong></p>

<p>This is an understandable point of confusion, because most output from Git is in the form of diffs.
Additionally, many other SCMs store changes as diffs instead of snapshots.
However, Git stores an entire snapshot of each modified file.</p>

<p>If you want to see an explanation from someone much smarter than me, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rALm7BCCY-0#t=6m28s">this video</a>.</p>

<h2>Illustrating Snapshots</h2>

<p>The easiest way to show how Git stores snapshots is create a project and show the relative sizes of the .git object folder.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/itsananderson/alice">sample project on GitHub</a> that contains two commits.
The first commit introduces the text of Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland.
The second commit makes a small modification to the text.</p>

<p>If you clone the repository and unpack the individual objects, you&rsquo;ll see something like the following when you inspect the .git directory with <a href="http://windirstat.info/">WinDirStat</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/alice-windirstat.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, Git stores two blobs of (nearly) identical size, one for each version of the text.
If Git stored diffs, you&rsquo;d expect to see one large blob, and a second much smaller blob (plus other objects for the tree etc.)</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t exactly a scientific proof about Git&rsquo;s behavior, but hopefully it illustrates it enough to get the point across.
If you want a more detailed explanation about how Git stores data, you can watch the YouTube video above, or read the Git documentation.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/09/16/introducing-edge-git/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-16T22:50:30-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/09/16/introducing-edge-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been frustrated by the lack of functional Node bindings for <a href="https://libgit2.github.com/">libgit2</a>.
The most prominent projects are <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/node-gitteh">node-gitteh</a> and <a href="">nodegit</a>.
Unfortunately both repositories are severely lacking in features and documentation.
I couldn&rsquo;t even install node-gitteh on Windows, and I spent an unsuccessful evening trying to get nodegit to do something as simple as fetching changes.</p>

<p>Eventually I came to the conclusion that no libgit2 bindings for Node are functional enough for my use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d used <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp">LibGit2Sharp</a> for a .NET project in the past.
It&rsquo;s an amazingly high-quality project.
While the documentation is sparse, the copious unit tests make it easy to figure out how to accomplish different tasks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read about <a href="http://tjanczuk.github.io/edge/">Edge.js</a>, which lets you interop between .NET and Node, but hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything with it.
Since I had a seemingly perfect use case, I decided to dive in.</p>

<p>About a week later, I have a very basic initial release of <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/edge-git">edge-git.</a>
About all you can do at this point is init, clone, and query branches/commits, but I&rsquo;m steadily adding more bindings to the existing LibGit2Sharp functionality.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/08/12/the-dark-side-of-the-force-push/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T23:26:08-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/08/12/the-dark-side-of-the-force-push</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about force pushing in Git.
We&rsquo;ll cover when you should do it, when you shouldn&rsquo;t, and how to do it safely.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Do this:</p>

<p><img src="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/obi-wan-droids.gif" alt="Force Push Droids" /></p>

<p>Not this:</p>

<p><img src="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/obi-wan-hates.gif" alt="Force Push Fail" /></p>

<h2>Pushing Changes</h2>

<p>When you push changes to a remote server, Git prevents you from pushing your changes if the remote has changes you&rsquo;re missing.
This feature is designed to prevent data loss.
If you run into this, you&rsquo;ll likely see a message similar to this:</p>

<p><code>
$ git push origin my-branch
To git@github.com:itsananderson/foo.git
 ! [rejected]        my-branch -&gt; my-branch (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:itsananderson/foo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
</code></p>

<p>99% of the time, the appropriate solution to this message is to <code>git pull</code> to fetch changes from the server,
then <code>git push origin my-branch</code> to push your updated branch to the server.</p>

<h2>Rebasing</h2>

<p>The only real exception to the &ldquo;always pull, then push&rdquo; rule, is rebasing.
When you rebase, you&rsquo;re creating a copy of your commit history.
Git treats this new copy of history as a completely different set of commits (because it is).</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into deep detail about rebasing, because it&rsquo;s been covered many times before.
GitHub has a good <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-git-rebase">tutorial on rebasing</a>.
If you want some <a href="http://willi.am/git-fundamentals-rebasing/">high-level concept slides on rebasing</a>, I wrote some for a team presentation.</p>

<p>Point is, when you rebase a branch that you&rsquo;ve pushed to a remote server, your copy of the branch and the server&rsquo;s copy will be considered completely distinct.
This means when you try to push, the remote server will reject your changes because they&rsquo;re not a fast-forward.
However, if you <code>git pull</code>, you&rsquo;ll end up with two copies of the branch which are then merged with a merge commit.
In addition to muddling your commit history, this will re-introduce whatever you were trying to change with your rebase.</p>

<p>In this very specific case, the correct solution <em>might</em> be to <code>git push origin my-branch -f</code>.</p>

<h2>Force Push Basics</h2>

<p>So you have a branch that you&rsquo;ve rebased, and you want to force push it to the remote server.</p>

<p><img src="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/force-push-will-smith.gif" alt="Will Smith Force Push" /></p>

<p>First, make sure nobody&rsquo;s pulled down your branch and done local work off of it.
If they have, your force push may make it difficult for them to reconcile their changes with yours.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working on a team and need to rebase a shared branch, here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure your team has committed and pushed any pending changes</li>
<li>Ask your team to pause work on that branch temporarily</li>
<li>Make sure you have the latest changes for that branch (git pull)</li>
<li>Rebase, then <code>git push origin &lt;yourbranch&gt; -f</code></li>
<li>Have your team fix up their local branches with <code>git checkout &lt;yourbranch&gt;</code>, <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git reset --hard origin/&lt;yourbranch&gt;</code></li>
</ol>


<p>As you can see, this is a complicated process.
It requires team coordination, and potentially blocks team members from doing work while you rebase.
As a general rule, avoid rebasing or otherwise modifying history on pushed branches unless you&rsquo;ve accidentally published <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data">sensitive data</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working alone, the process is a little simpler.
Simply rebase and then <code>git push origin &lt;yourbranch&gt; -f</code>.
Keep in mind, however, that you may still cause headaches for other people if you rebase on a public GitHub (Bitbucket, etc.) repository.</p>

<h2>Aside: Understanding Remote Tracking Branches</h2>

<p>Git uses the concept of remote tracking branches (or branch upstreams) to help you associate your local branches with the branches on remote servers.
If you&rsquo;ve ever seen this message, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s talking about: <code>Branch my-branch set up to track remote branch my-branch origin.</code></p>

<p>Additionally, if you&rsquo;ve seen this message when you ran <code>git status</code>, it means your branch is tracking a remote branch:</p>

<p><code>
On branch my-branch
Your branch and 'origin/my-branch' have diverged,
and have 5 and 2 different commit each, respectively.
</code></p>

<p>Finally, when you run <code>git pull</code> or <code>git push</code>, Git can use the remote tracking branch to know which remote branch to interact with.
This keeps you from having to type <code>git pull origin my-branch</code> every time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a blog post with more info on <a href="http://felipec.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/advanced-git-concepts-the-upstream-tracking-branch/">remote tracking branches and upstreams</a>.</p>

<h2>Force Push Pitfalls</h2>

<p>When you start force pushing, there are a few pitfalls you should be aware of.</p>

<p><img src="http://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/force-push-yoda.gif" alt="Yoda Force Push" /></p>

<h3>Overwriting Changes</h3>

<p>Before you force push a branch, double check that nobody has pushed new changes to that branch.
If they have, and you don&rsquo;t pull them in, you&rsquo;ll overwrite them when you force push.</p>

<p>With online source control, you can just browse the repository and check the commit history for your branch.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a web UI, you can also check directly in the source.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>git fetch</code> to pull down the latest changes to your machine</li>
<li>Run <code>git log origin/&lt;yourbranch&gt;</code> to remote branch&rsquo;s log</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t see any new commits, it&rsquo;s probably safe to proceed (ignoring developer race conditions)</li>
<li>If you see new changes, resolve them into your local branch before you force push</li>
</ol>


<p>As with software, you can run into a race condition.
If somebody pushes changes between when you fetch and when you push, you may still overwrite them.
To avoid this, communicate with your team.
A simple &ldquo;don&rsquo;t push anything on <yourbranch> for a minute&rdquo;, followed up by an &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; should do the trick.</p>

<h3>Overwriting Other Branches</h3>

<p>When you push and pull, Git can use remote tracking branches (see above) to infer which remote branch you want to push/pull from.
This is generally ok for normal push/pull activity, but when you force push, it can be dangerous.</p>

<p>By default, Git responds to <code>git push</code> by pushing <em>all</em> branches that exist on both your local machine and the remote server.
This means, if you have commits on master and my-feature-branch, and you run <code>git push</code>, it will push your changes from both branches at once.</p>

<p>In Git 2.0, this behavior was changed to only push the current branch, but older versions still have this unexpected behavior.
To fix it, run the following command:</p>

<p><code>git config --global push.default simple</code></p>

<p>Now if you run <code>git push</code>, it will only try to push your current branch.</p>

<p>The default push behavior becomes especially dangerous when you force push.
If, for example, you run <code>git push -f</code>, and your master branch is behind the remote server&rsquo;s master,
you may accidentally remove commits from master.</p>

<p>For this reason, I recommend two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure push.default with the safer <code>simple</code> setting</li>
<li>Always explicitly state the remote and branch name when you force push: <code>git push -f origin my-feature-branch</code></li>
</ol>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a good overview of the how/why/when of force pushing.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, be sure to read the section on force push pitfalls.
They&rsquo;re important to understand, and they&rsquo;re the main reason I wrote this post.</p>
