    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m too familiar with the languages I use every day.
Well, I say that as if this is a recent realization.
I decided this about a year ago, and decided Clojure was the next language I should learn.</p>

<p>I did some initial research on the language, and found <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">a Clojure book</a> by an author I&rsquo;d read before.
It had a second edition coming out soon, so I decided to pre-order that.</p>

<p>A year later, the book is finally on the way :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good timing, though.
The last year has been a whirlwind.
I joined a new team at work, worked on 5-6 projects (literally lost count), and bought a house.
You know, the usual.</p>

<p>Things are finally settling down again a little, so what better time to take on another hobby?</p>
