    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve created an Express 4 app with the new scaffold utility recently, you may have noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t work in Azure. When you try to load the site, it fails with the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Diagnosis</h2>

<p>This is because of the new structure Express creates for its apps. Instead of app.js being the expected entry point, Express now specifies bin/www as the entry point for starting the server.</p>

<p>I suspect the reason for this is so that the newly scaffolded app can be consumed as a module, allowing the consumer to worry about port binding etc. Unfortunately, this causes problems for Azure.</p>

<p>When Azure starts a Node.js site, it looks for either a server.js or an app.js. As far as I can tell from my admittedly limited testing, it doesn&rsquo;t seem look at package.json for an alternate entry point. Because of this, when it includes app.js, nothing ever binds to the listening port, so the app immediately exits on startup.</p>

<h2>The Workaround</h2>

<p>Since Azure first looks for a server.js file when it starts a site, the easiest solution I&rsquo;ve found is to add a <code>server.js</code> file with the following contents.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">www</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now, when Azure starts your site, it will require server.js, which will require bin/www, which will require app.js. After that somewhat convoluted redirection chain, all will again be right in the world.</p>

<p>The Azure documentation has an <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-nodejs-develop-deploy-express-app/">alternative workaround</a> (see steps 4 and 5 of &ldquo;Install Express&rdquo;), but I don&rsquo;t care for it.
The problem with their solution is that it duplicates the code from bin/www into server.js, which means any updates you make to bin/www will also need to be applied to server.js.
Long story short, code duplication sucks.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things that would properly solve this problem instead of just working around it.</p>

<h3>Express Scaffold Fix</h3>

<p>There are probably a few ways Express could fix this, but the simplest I can think of would be to add a server.js that does the same thing as my workaround.
If that&rsquo;s not desirable for all sites, they could add a &ldquo;Azure compatibility&rdquo; flag that explicitly adds the sever.js workaround.</p>

<h3>Azure Fix</h3>

<p>In my oppinion, Azure should have a way to specify the entry-point in package.json rather than hardcoding to app.js and server.js.</p>

<p>The conventional <code>npm start</code> configuration is a logical place to begin, since it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html">supported spec from npm</a>.</p>

<p>```
{</p>

<pre><code>"scripts": {
    "start" : "&lt;path&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Azure relies on iisnode, which probably can&rsquo;t consume package.json directly.
However, Azure could look at a setting in package.json during the site setup process (when it does stuff like package restore), and configure web.config, just like it does now to switch between app.js and server.js.</p>
