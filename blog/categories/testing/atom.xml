    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I blogged about <a href="/blog/2016/08/22/writing-useful-tests-organization/">organizing your tests</a> so that they&rsquo;re easier to maintain.
Today I want to look at why you should put thought into naming your tests and writing assertions.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you first write your tests, you (hopefully) have all the context of the code you&rsquo;re testing.
You know how the code should work, and you know what your test is trying to validate.
However, if the test starts failing 6 months down the road, you probably won&rsquo;t have all that context.
Writing verbose test names and assertion messages will make it much easier for you to regain that context.</p>

<h2>Naming Things</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday, and you just poured your first cup of &ldquo;Damn Fine Coffee&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="https://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/damngoodcoffee.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re checking the morning influx of email and open an email about failing tests.
You&rsquo;re greeted with this helpful summary:</p>

<p>```
Failing Tests:
  &ndash; User Creation</p>

<p>  Expected &ldquo;false&rdquo; to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s helpful&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/more-coffee.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Obviously this is a contrived example, but it illustrates two potential problems with your tests.</p>

<h2>Problem 1: Generic Names</h2>

<p>In the example above, the test is called &ldquo;User Creation&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t very descriptive.
Now you have to find the code for the test and re-grok it, just to remember what the test does.
Only then can you figure out why it&rsquo;s failing.</p>

<p><img src="https://itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/donna-crying.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>It might be better to call this test something like &ldquo;User creation succeeds with valid email and matching passwords&rdquo; or &ldquo;User creation fails with an invalid email&rdquo;.
If the test does more than what those detailed titles describe, it&rsquo;s probably time to break it into smaller tests.</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Generic Assertions</h2>

<p>The other thing you&rsquo;ll notice from the example is the reason the test failed: <code>Expected "false" to be "true"</code>.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t really help you track down the problem.
You know there&rsquo;s probably a failing assertion, but if you have many &ldquo;assert&rdquo; statements in your test, it may not be immediately clear whith one failed.
Adding a clear assertion message can make it much simpler to track down the part of the test that&rsquo;s failing.</p>

<p>```javascript
// Before
var succeeded = false;
assert(succeeded);
// Expected &ldquo;false&rdquo; to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;</p>

<p>// After
var succeeded = false;
assert(succeeded, &ldquo;User creation should have succeeded&rdquo;);
// Expected &ldquo;false&rdquo; to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;. User creation should have succeeded
```</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s easy to find the assertion in your code that&rsquo;s failing.
Plus, your &ldquo;tests are failing&rdquo; email will tell you why the test is failing before you&rsquo;ve even fired up your editor.</p>

<h2>That Was Easy</h2>

<p>Ok. You&rsquo;ve fixed your tests. Time to treat yourself to more coffee, and maybe some donuts.</p>

    <updated>2016-08-22T20:31:32-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2016/08/22/writing-useful-tests-organization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people agree that writing tests is an important part of software development.
However, not all tests are created equal.</p>

<p>Working on a number of projects over the years, I&rsquo;ve run into a few pitfalls and gotchas that I want to cover in the next few blog posts.
This won&rsquo;t be a comprehensive guide to testing.
Others have already done a better job of that than I ever could.
I just want to write down the pain points I&rsquo;ve run into, and the techniques that have worked for me.</p>

<h2>Organizing Your Tests</h2>

<p>Figuring out how to organize your tests can be a daunting task, especially when you&rsquo;re starting a new project.
Do you keep your tests beside your feature code, or do you have two distinct &ldquo;src&rdquo; and &ldquo;test&rdquo; directories?
Do you break up your test files by feature? By class? By unit?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one right answer to these questions, but I know what has and hasn&rsquo;t worked for me on my projects.</p>

<h3>Test Location</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of keeping your tests close to your source code.
That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean every <code>foo.js</code> has a <code>foo.test.js</code> beside it, but I do prefer having source code and test code in the same project, rather than keeping them in distinct source folders.</p>

<p>This collocation of tests and source code encourages the mindset of writing tests and source code being one and the same.
I&rsquo;ve worked on projects where the tests and source were in very different parts of the source repository, and the typical workflow was to write your code, and then figure out how to test it.
Keeping your tests and source code in the same project doesn&rsquo;t necessarily solve this problem completely, but at least it helps keep your tests readily available as you&rsquo;re writing your feature or bug fix.</p>

<h3>Breaking Up Your Tests</h3>

<p>Breaking up your tests into distinct files (and folders if your project is large enough) is a good way to keep them manageable.
I&rsquo;ve worked on projects that had thousands of lines of code in the same test file, and it was a nightmare to find and update tests within those enormous files.
By contrast, projects that have been broken into smaller focused test files made it much easier to find where a test should be added or updated.</p>

<p>How you break up your tests will partly depend on your programming language and the type of project.
I&rsquo;ve found that a good place to look for test grouping is the setup code for your tests.
If you have the same few lines of setup code in several of your tests, consider putting them in the same test file with a shared <code>beforeEach</code> block.
What this looks like will depend on your language and test framework.</p>

<p>By contrast, if you find that your <code>beforeEach</code> block is doing a lot of setup that&rsquo;s not used by most of the tests, consider breaking the file apart into the pieces that use the different components of the setup block.</p>

<p>When you open a test file, it should be clear from the file name what feature(s) are being tested. This will help you navigate your test codebase when it&rsquo;s time to update or add tests.</p>

<h3>Arrange, Act, Assert</h3>

<p>When talking about test structure, it&rsquo;s common to discuss the three parts of a test: Arrange, Act, and Assert.</p>

<ul>
<li>Arrange &ndash; Set up the variables, objects, and mocks you&rsquo;ll use in your test</li>
<li>Act &ndash; Perform the action that you&rsquo;re attempting to test</li>
<li>Assert &ndash; Verify that the action had the expected result</li>
</ul>


<p>This organization structure for tests is probably a clich√©, but it&rsquo;s a useful way to think about how you organize your individual tests.
Writing tests that have clear distinctions between these three sections will make it easier for other maintainers to understand what you&rsquo;re trying to test.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes had tests where these distinctions were hard to make, or where I felt like I needed to intermingle assertions in the other parts of the tests.
This usually meant that I was testing too much, and needed to break into multiple tests.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Organizing your tests makes them easier to understand, navigate, and update, which makes it much easier and more enjoyable for you and your team to maintain them.
Putting effort and thought into your test structure now will pay dividends in the future.</p>

<p>Next time I&rsquo;ll talk about naming your tests and writing useful test assertion messages.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/07/28/test-your-api-with-supertest/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-28T14:18:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/07/28/test-your-api-with-supertest</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/package/supertest">Supertest</a> is a fantastic tool for testing your API.
Here&rsquo;s how I use it to test APIs.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>You can configure supertest in a couple ways.
If you&rsquo;re testing an external site, you can configure supertest with the site&rsquo;s base url:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var request = require('supertest')('http://example.com/');
</code></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re testing an Express app, you can pass the app to supertest, and let it worry about setup/teardown of your site.</p>

<p><code>javascript
var myApp = require('../app.js');
var request = require('supertest')(myApp);
</code></p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that supertest takes care of starting up and shutting down your site on a random port.
This allows you to just write your tests, without worrying about starting apps, conflicting ports, etc.</p>

<h2>Writing a Test</h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve imported supertest, it&rsquo;s quite simple to use.
In my examples, I&rsquo;ll be using the test framework provided by <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/mocha">Mocha</a>.</p>

<p>```javascript
describe(&lsquo;my api&rsquo;, function() {</p>

<pre><code>it('returns hello world', function(done) {
    request.
        .get('/')
        .expect('Hello, World!', done);
});
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>This is about as simple as the tests get.
We call the root of the site, and expect the response body to equal &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Since the request is async, we take in a &ldquo;done&rdquo; parameter (which Mocha passes to us).
We call that at the end of the test when we&rsquo;ve actually had a chance to verify the server response.</p>

<p>You can easily test a JSON response with supertest:</p>

<p>```javascript
request.</p>

<pre><code>.get('/')
.expect({message: "Hello, World!"}, done);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Headers are also simple to verify.</p>

<p>```javascript
request.</p>

<pre><code>.get('/foo')
.expect('Content-Type', 'application/json', done);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Status codes are even easier.</p>

<p>```javascript
request</p>

<pre><code>.get('/some-error-route')
.expect(500, 'Oops. Something went wrong', done);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You can do non-GET requests.</p>

<p>```javascript
var user = {name: &lsquo;Bob&rsquo;};
request</p>

<pre><code>.post('/create-user')
.send(user)
.expect({success:true}, done);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You can set headers for the request.</p>

<p>```javascript
request</p>

<pre><code>.get('/foo')
.set('Accept', 'text/plain')
.expect('Content-Type', 'text/plain', done);
</code></pre>

<p>```
You can match regular expressions against headers and bodies.</p>

<p>```javascript
request</p>

<pre><code>.get('/redirect')
.expect('Location': /\/destination/)
.expect(301, done);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If you need to do multiple requests in series, you can chain the &ldquo;expect&rdquo; callbacks:</p>

<p>```javascript
// Kick things off
purgeUsers();</p>

<p>function purgeUsers() {</p>

<pre><code>request
    .get('/users/purge')
    .expect({success:true}, checkNoUsers);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function checkNoUsers(err) {</p>

<pre><code>if (err) done(err);
request
    .get('/users')
    .expect([], addUser);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function addUser() {</p>

<pre><code>if (err) done(err);
request
    .post('/users')
    .send({name: 'Bob'})
    .expect({success:true}, checkUsers);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function checkUsers(err) {</p>

<pre><code>if (err) done(err);
request
    .get('/users')
    .expect([{name: 'Bob'}], done);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Finally, if you need to do some custom processing on a result, use the <code>.end()</code> function.</p>

<p>```javascript
var assert = require(&lsquo;assert&rsquo;);
request</p>

<pre><code>.get('/foo')
.end(function(err, result) {
    assert.equal(result.body.foo, 'Bar');
    done();
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>There are probably more features that I&rsquo;m not aware of, but this is a rundown of the ones I&rsquo;m most familiar with.</p>
