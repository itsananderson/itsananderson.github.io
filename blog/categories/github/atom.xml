    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a Windows developer like me, you&rsquo;ve probably had trouble working with GitHub on Windows. Here&rsquo;s what I did. Hopefully this will be helpful to you.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>First you need to grab a copy of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">Git for Windows</a>.
Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the latest version, launch it and go through the license and location screens.
Once you get to the &ldquo;Select Components&rdquo; screen, make sure both Context menu entries are selected.
If you want, select the TrueType font option.
That one shouldn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1130 aligncenter" title="select-components" alt="" src="//itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/select-components.png" width="539" height="428" /></p>

<p>Jump ahead a few more frames and you&rsquo;ll get to the SSH executable option.
Choose &ldquo;OpenSSH&rdquo;, unless you have a compelling reason to use Plink.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1131" title="openssh" alt="" src="//itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/openssh.png" width="546" height="432" /></p>

<p>Run through the rest of the frames, accepting the defaults.
You now have Git installed on your machine, but we&rsquo;re not quite done yet.
GitHub uses public/private key encryption.
This means you don&rsquo;t commit with a username and password, like most SVN setups.
Instead, you tell GitHub your public key, then use your private key to authenticate.</p>

<h2>Generating a Public Key</h2>

<p>GitHub has a detailed article on setting up your SSH keys on Mac/Windows/Linux.
I recommend <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">checking it out</a>.</p>

<h2>Clone a Repository From GitHub</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re just about there.
Go to your GitHub repository and select and copy the text in the textbox near the top of the page.
Make sure SSH is selected.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1135" title="github-url" alt="" src="//itsananderson.blob.core.windows.net/post-images/github-url.png" width="664" height="33" /></p>

<p>Open up Git Bash.
You should be able to find it in your start menu.
&ldquo;cd&rdquo; to the directory where you plan on checking out your code.
For example, if you want your code to be located in C:\programming\project then you want to &ldquo;cd&rdquo; to C:\programming.</p>

<p>Type out &ldquo;git clone &rdquo;, but don&rsquo;t hit enter yet.
Go to the top left corner of the Git Bash window and click.
In the menu that pops up, select Edit &ndash;> Paste to paste the URL of your repository, but still don&rsquo;t hit enter.
Finally, type the name you want to call the project folder.
In our example, you&rsquo;d want something like this:</p>

<p><code>git clone git@github.com:itsananderson/wp-sendgrid.git project</code></p>

<p>Now you can hit enter :)</p>

<p>If you entered a passphrase for your private key, it will ask you for it.
If all goes well, your repository should be downloaded.</p>

<h2>Some Sample Commands</h2>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a tutorial on Git commands, but here are a few to get you started:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>See what files have changed:</h1>

<p>git status</p>

<h1>Add a file (new or modified, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You need to add it to commit it)</h1>

<p>git add file.php</p>

<h1>Add several files:</h1>

<p>git add *.php</p>

<h1>Commit your changes locally (just stores a local snapshot of your changes):</h1>

<p>git commit -m &ldquo;Your commit message here&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Push your changes up to GitHub:</h1>

<p>git push -u origin master</p>

<h1>Pull down updates from GitHub:</h1>

<p>git pull
```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about it.
There&rsquo;s more to Git (which I&rsquo;m still learning about), but this should hopefully be enough to help you get started.</p>
