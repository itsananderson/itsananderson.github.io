<h2>Uploading to Azure Blob Storage</h2>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/2014/07/01/azure-blob-storage-and-node-first-steps/">previous post</a>, we talked about how to set up and connect to an Azure Storage account, and how to create a blob container.
Today we&rsquo;ll discuss how to upload blobs.</p>

<h3>Account Connection Boilerplate</h3>

<p>To upload to blob storage, you first need to create a client instance.
To avoid duplicating code over and over, we&rsquo;ll do that once here, and assume it in the other code samples.</p>

<p>```javascript
var storage = require(&lsquo;azure-storage&rsquo;);
var blobService = storage.createBlobService();
var containerName = &lsquo;your-container-name&rsquo;;
blobService.createContainerIfNotExists(containerName, function(err, result, response) {</p>

<pre><code>if (err) {
    console.log("Couldn't create container %s", containerName);
    console.error(err);
} else {
    if (result) {
        console.log('Container %s created', containerName);
    } else {
        console.log('Container %s already exists', containerName);
    }

    // Your code goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Now for the rest of the code samples, we&rsquo;ll assume that they&rsquo;re replacing the &ldquo;Your code goes here&rdquo; placeholder in the code above.</p>

<h3>Uploading a String</h3>

<p>Uploading a string is easy with the <code>createBlockBlobFromText</code> method.</p>

<p>```javascript
blobService.createBlockBlobFromText(</p>

<pre><code>containerName,
'my-awesome-text-blob',
'Hello, World!',
function(error, result, response){
    if(error){
        console.log("Couldn't upload string");
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log('String uploaded successfully');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The above code creates a blob called &ldquo;my-awesome-text-blob&rdquo; inside our container with the content &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Uploading a File</h3>

<p>Uploading a file is just as simple as uploading a string. Use the <code>createBlockBlobFromFile</code> method.</p>

<p>```javascript
var fileName = &lsquo;hello-world.txt&rsquo;;
blobService.createBlockBlobFromFile(</p>

<pre><code>containerName,
'my-awesome-file-blob',
fileName,
function(error, result, response){
    if(error){
        console.log("Couldn't upload file %s", fileName);
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log('File %s uploaded successfully', fileName);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The above code creates a blob called &ldquo;my-awesome-file-blob&rdquo; inside our container with the contents of &ldquo;hello-world.txt&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Uploading a Stream</h3>

<p>Again, uploading streams is easy with azure-storage.
Just use the <code>createBlockBlobFromStream</code> method.
The one caveat here is that you need to know the length of the stream you&rsquo;re uploading.</p>

<p>```javascript
// For simplicity, assume getSomeStream() returns a readable stream
var myStream = getSomeStream();
var myStreamLength = getSomeStreamLength();
blobService.createBlockBlobFromStream(</p>

<pre><code>containerName,
'my-awesome-stream-blob',
myStream,
myStreamLength,
function(error, result, response){
    if(error){
        console.log("Couldn't upload stream");
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log('Stream uploaded successfully');
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Uploading an HTTP Response</h3>

<p>You can also download a file and upload it to blob storage.
This is useful for things like caching API responses.</p>

<p>For this, we&rsquo;ll use <code>createWriteStreamToBlockBlob</code> to get a writable stream that saves to a blob.</p>

<p>```javascript
var http = require(&lsquo;http&rsquo;);</p>

<p>var fileName = &lsquo;index.html&rsquo;;
var domain = &lsquo;example.com&rsquo;;
var requestOptions = {</p>

<pre><code>host: domain,
port: 80,
path: '/' + fileName
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>http.get(requestOptions, function (httpResponse) {</p>

<pre><code>if (200 !== httpResponse.statusCode) {
    console.log('Unexpected status code: %d', httpResponse.statusCode);
} else {
    var writeStream = blobService.createWriteStreamToBlockBlob(
        containerName,
        fileName,
        { contentType: 'text/html' },
        function(error, result, response){
            if(error){
                console.log("Couldn't upload file %s from %s", fileName, domain);
                console.error(error);
            } else {
                console.log('File %s from %s uploaded', fileName, domain);
            }
        });
    httpResponse.pipe(writeStream);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}).on(&lsquo;error&rsquo;, function(e) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("Got error: " + e.message);
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>This example is a bit more complex, but the main idea is to create a write stream for the blob we want to create.
Then we fetch <a href="http://example.com/index.html">http://example.com/index.html</a> and <code>.pipe</code> the response to the blob&rsquo;s write stream;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re doing this in a web server, you&rsquo;ll probably also want to pipe the http.get response to the client.</p>

<p>```javascript
app.get(&lsquo;/somepath&rsquo;, function(req, res) {</p>

<pre><code>http.get(requestOptions, function (httpResponse) {
    if (200 !== httpResponse.statusCode) {
        res.send(502, 'Unexpected status code: ' + httpResponse.statusCode);
    } else {

        // ...
        // Blob stream setup code from above
        // ...

        // Pipe server response to both the blob and the client who made this request
        httpResponse.pipe(writeStream);
        httpResponse.pipe(res);
    }
}).on('error', function(e) {
    res.send(502, "Got error: " + e.message);
});
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<h3>Setting a Content Type</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that the previoius example passed an extra option to <code>createWriteStreamToBlockBlob</code>.
There are a number of properties you can set on a blob, but the most useful is the contentType property.
This determines the Content-Type header that will be set if the blob is accessed or streamed directly from blob storage.</p>

<p>By default the content type is set to &lsquo;application/octet-stream&rsquo;.
If you create a blob with this type and try to access it with your browser, it will simply be downloaded rather than displayed as the desired type (text, html, image).</p>

<p>To set a custom content type, pass something like <code>{ contentType: 'image/jpeg' }</code> before your callback function.
Note that <code>createBlockBlobFromFile</code> will infer the content type from the file extension.
Also,<code>createBlockBlobFromText</code> automatically sets the content type to <code>text/plain;charset="utf-9"</code> when it&rsquo;s given a string.</p>

<p>There are a number of other properties that can be set on a blob, including contentEncoding, contentLanguage, and metadata (which will be covered in a later post).</p>

<p>The easiest way to see the different options is to look in <code>lib\services\blob\blobservice.js</code> inside the azure-storage package.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this post we&rsquo;ve covered the many ways to create Azure blobs in Node.

<li>Blob Metadata</li>
<li>All Together</li>
</ol>


<h2>Getting Started With Azure Blob Storage and Node</h2>

<p>The Azure team has made it really simple to start using Blob Storage in Node.
The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/azure-storage">azure-storage</a> module into your project.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>Make sure you have a package.json so npm can save your azure-storage dependency</h1>

<p>npm install &mdash;save azure-storage
```</p>

<h3>Create Storage Account</h3>

<p>Unless you already have one, you&rsquo;ll need to create an Azure storage account.
They&rsquo;re pretty simple to create.
From the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">Azure portal</a>, click &ldquo;New&rdquo; in the bottom-left.
Select &ldquo;Data Services&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Storage&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Quick Create&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Enter a unique name for your account.
Under &ldquo;Location/Affinity Group&rdquo;, choose a location.
Ideally, you should choose the same location as your web site or web service.
If in doubt, choose the location nearest to you.</p>

<p>During dev time, you probably won&rsquo;t want to work against production data.
To avoid this, you can create a second storage account using the steps above.</p>

<h3>Configure Access Keys</h3>

<p>In order for your Node app to connect to your storage account, you&rsquo;ll need to configure it with its access information.
These instructions assume you&rsquo;ve already <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-nodejs-develop-deploy-express-app/">created an Azure Website</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways to configure the azure-storage module&rsquo;s access info.
One way is by constructing an Azure client object with a hardcoded account name and an access key.
The problem with this approach is that it requires checking your access key in with your code, which you shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>The other appraoch is to use environment variables to store your account info.
The azure-storage module will pick up specific environment variables and use those to connect to your storage account.
Those environment variables are <code>AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT</code> and <code>AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY</code>, or <code>AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING</code>.
In our example, we&rsquo;ll use the first two.</p>

<p>First, in the Azure portal, navigate to your storage account.
At the bottom of the screen, click &ldquo;Manage Access Keys&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-images/azure-account-access-keys.png"></p>

<p>Copy the primary access key, then navigate to your website&rsquo;s &ldquo;Configure&rdquo; tab.
Under &ldquo;app settings&rdquo;, add two new settings:
<code>AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT</code> with your storage account name, and <code>AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY</code> with the access key you just copied.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-images/website-access-key-configuration.png"></p>

<p>For local dev, you&rsquo;ll also need to set up credentials for your dev storage account (or production if you didn&rsquo;t create a dev account).
On Linux and Mac, you can set environment variables in your <code>.bash_profile</code>.
Instructions for that are outside the scope of this post.</p>

<p>On Linux and Mac you can also set environment variables specifically for an app run.
This also works on Windows if you&rsquo;re using something like Git Bash.</p>

<p><code>bash
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=mystorage AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=123-my-access-key node app.js
</code></p>

<p>On windows, the easiest option is to configure environment variables in your machine settings.
These instructions are for Windows 8.
You&rsquo;ll have to look for instructions for older versions of Windows, but the idea is pretty much the same.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the start screen.</li>
<li>Type &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Edit environment variables for your account&rdquo; should come up.</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;New&hellip;&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Enter &ldquo;AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Variable name&rdquo; and your storage account name for the &ldquo;Variable value&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/post-images/storage-account-environment-variable.png"></p>

<p>Repeat steps 1 through 5 again for the &ldquo;AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY&rdquo; variable, then click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to close the &ldquo;Environment Variables&rdquo; screen.
If your console is open, restart it.</p>

<h3>Write Some Code</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve gotten the configuration taken care of, we can write some code.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll dive into the code more in the next post, but for now, here&rsquo;s something to get you started.</p>

<p>```javascript
var storage = require(&lsquo;azure-storage&rsquo;);
var blobService = storage.createBlobService();
var containerName = &lsquo;your-container-name&rsquo;;
blobService.createContainerIfNotExists(containerName, function(err, result, response) {</p>

<pre><code>if (err) {
    console.log("Couldn't create container %s", containerName);
    console.error(err);
} else {
    if (result) {
        console.log('Container %s created', containerName);
    } else {
        console.log('Container %s already exists', containerName);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>If you run the above code after configuring your account credentials, it should output &ldquo;Container your-container-name created&rdquo;.
If you run it again, it should output &ldquo;Container your-container-name already exists&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Azure only creates the container if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.
If it already exists, the library will tell you, but it won&rsquo;t give you an error.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at how to get set up with Azure blob storage.
In the next post, we&rsquo;ll talk about <a href="/blog/2014/07/02/azure-blob-storage-and-node-creating-blobs/">creating blobs</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I put together a service called <a href="http://placebacon.net">placebacon</a> that serves placeholder bacon images.
It&rsquo;s certainly not the first placeholder image service, but it&rsquo;s the first one that makes your designs look delicious :)</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://placebacon.net/800/100?image=9">http://placebacon.net/800/100?image=9</a>"></p>

<p>I decided to build the service on Azure so that it can easily be scaled if anyone actually starts using it.
Caching generated images with Azure Blob Storage made the most sense.</p>

<p>The Azure team has released an npm package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/azure-storage">azure-storage</a>, which I used to interact with the Azure Blobs.
The documentation for the azure-storage package is fairly good, but I still mostly found myself digging into the source code to figure things out.
I&rsquo;m writing this blog series to make it easier for other Node developers to work with the Node bindings for Azure Blob Storage.</p>

<h2>Placebacon&rsquo;s Service Architecture</h2>

<p>To set a framework for the upcoming discussions about Blob Storage, I&rsquo;m providing a high-level overview of placebacon&rsquo;s architecture.</p>

<p>First, I need a way to resize images in Node.
After spending several frustrating hours trying to find an image manipulation module that works in Windows, I decided that a Linux VM would be the easiest way to resize images in Node.
Since I&rsquo;m using the Azure infrastructure, setting up a Linux VM is straightforward, but I also want to take advantage of the simple scaling ability of Azure Websites.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I decided to have a lightweight Ubuntu VM for resizing images.
Then I put together an Azure website (in Node, of course) that requests resized images from the service running on Ubuntu, and caches the results in Blob Storage.</p>

<p>This (literal) back-of-an-envolope drawing illustrates the layout.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post-images/placebacon-architecture.jpg"></p>

<p>With the architecture design out of the way, next time I&rsquo;ll cover the <a href="/blog/2014/07/01/azure-blob-storage-and-node-first-steps/">steps for getting started with Azure Blob Storage</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://willi.am/blog/2014/06/27/thoughts-on-implementing-a-rest-level-3-api-in-node/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-27T20:25:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://willi.am/blog/2014/06/27/thoughts-on-implementing-a-rest-level-3-api-in-node</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Warning: stream of consciousness ahead</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the the pieces that would be needed to implement a REST Level 3 API in Node.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of REST Level 3 in this post, but the one of the most important concepts is that clients to the API don&rsquo;t manually build URIs for their API calls, but instead receive them as hypermedia metadata from other calls to your API.</p>

<p>Node has some great frameworks for building web servers.
I frequently use <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, which is built on top of the <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/">Connect</a> middleware package.
Unfortunately, Express doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to add hypermedia links to API responses in a DRY way.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://mcavage.me/node-restify/">node-restify</a>.
This is a popular choice for building REST APIs in Node, but again, it falls down when it comes to Hypermedia.
Here at least you can link to different API endpoints without hardcoding URLs, but there&rsquo;s still no unified way to automatically add hypermedia links to responses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried other frameworks as well.
<a href="http://hapijs.com/">Hapi</a> comes closest, but still doesn&rsquo;t quite solve my problems with hypermedia.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m spoiled by the relatively elegant solutions that can be accomplished in strictly typed languages.
In C#, for example, you can keep a registry of hypermedia providers associated with different types.
When a response of a specific type is returned by a controller, the assocated hypermedia provider is invoked, and it returns a dictionary of URIs for that type.
The controller doesn&rsquo;t even have to be aware of the hypermedia provider.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, it&rsquo;s a little harder to associate types with providers, since most responses are just anonymous objects.
I do have some alternative ideas, though.
The first that comes to mind is to associate with URLs.
Most importantly, being able to say &ldquo;this route, and any route below it uses the same provider&rdquo;.
For example, consider the following routes.</p>

<p><code>
GET  /users
POST /users
GET  /users/1
GET  /users/1/edit
GET  /users/1/delete
</code></p>

<p>All of those URLs could probably use an identical (or almost identical) link provider.
Something like the following would be useful:</p>

<p>```javascript
app.hypermedia(&lsquo;/users*&rsquo;, function(route, user) {</p>

<pre><code>if ( user ) {
    return {
        "self": "/users/" + user.id,
        "edit": "/users/" + user.id + "/edit",
        "delete": "/users/" + user.id + "/delete",
    };
} else {
    return {
        "find-all": "/users",
        "create": "/users",
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really tied to that syntax, nor is this an awesome example.
The main idea is, I want to abstract hypermedia so controllers don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>The other part of this is that controllers need to send their response back through a middleware, rather than directly to the client.
In my mind, this means the best solution is to return the object.
Since Node is async, simply returning the object probably isn&rsquo;t an option in most cases.
This means the next best choice would be to return a promise from the controller.
The middleware then waits for the promise to resolve, and then handles the result.
Finally, the controller should still be able to send a response directly to the client through the res.send() function.
In that case, no hypermedia links would be provided.</p>

<p>If the controller needs to make an async call, but that call doesn&rsquo;t automatically provide a promise, a nice simplification would be to provide a function on the response object that does the same thing.
For example:</p>

<p>```javascript
app.get(&lsquo;/user/:id&rsquo;, function(req, res) {</p>

<pre><code>db.getUser(req.params.id, function(err, user) {
    res.respond(user); // res.respond could invoke hypermedia providers before response 
});
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Of course you can usually use Q&rsquo;s &ldquo;denodify&rdquo; utilities, but the point here is a little flexibility. Here&rsquo;s how a Q promise might be returned. The framework would &ldquo;then&rdquo; the promise and essentially forward the result to <code>req.respond()</code>.</p>

<p>```javascript
app.get(&lsquo;/user/:id&rsquo;, function(req, res) {</p>

<pre><code>return Q.nfinvoke(db, "getUser", req.params.id);
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>If you want to do something with the promise result, you still can with promises.</p>

<p>```javascript
app.get(&lsquo;/user/:id&rsquo;, function(req, res) {</p>

<pre><code>return Q.nfinvoke(db, "getUser", req.params.id)
    .then(function(user) {
        if (!user) {
            var err = new Error('User not found');
            err.status = 404;
            throw err;
        } else {
            return user;
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>The other great thing to note here is that we don&rsquo;t have to call <code>next(err)</code> to pass this exception to our error handler. We can throw it, and let the framework <code>.catch()</code> the exception from the promise we return.</p>

<p>The basic idea for an implementation of this is that the routing framework calls your endpoint handler, and expects it to do one of three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Return a promise, or value (buffer, stream, string, javascript object)</li>
<li>Call <code>next()</code> to pass controll to the next handler</li>
<li>Call <code>res.send()</code>, <code>res.write()</code>, or <code>res.end()</code> like you would in Express</li>
</ol>


<p>In the first case, the framework can allow hypermedia providers, and theoretically anything, to modify the response &ldquo;on the way out the door&rdquo;.
This would be my main objective in implementing something like this.</p>

<p>I may take a stab at a prototype, but I realize that at this point, any Node web framework probably needs a name that starts with &ldquo;Yet Another&rdquo;.
Mostly, I&rsquo;m curious how well it would work for &ldquo;real&rdquo; api development.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Does something like this already exist? Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/itsananderson/">my Twitter account</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into an issue recently while writing <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/placebase">a node module</a>.
My process would sometimes complete its work, but wouldn&rsquo;t end.
After a bit of debugging, I figured out what was happening.</p>

<p>I had implemented a handler for the HTTP &ldquo;location&rdquo; header.
If a response came back with that header, I would ignore that response and go fetch the new location instead.
Unfortunately, whenever I did that, the process would finish fetching the new location, and then just hang there for about a minute bofore exiting.
The reason this happened was because I wasn&rsquo;t properly handling the first response.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an oversimplified explanation of what happens.
This is from my limited understanding of Node internals, so the details may be slighly off, but the overall idea is correct.</p>

<p>When you use the &ldquo;http&rdquo; module to make a request in Node, the response it gives you is a stream.
If you don&rsquo;t do anything to consume that stream&rsquo;s data, Node doesn&rsquo;t exit because there&rsquo;s still work to be done (consuming the stream).
In order to get Node to exit without something clunky like process.exit(), you just need to switch the stream to &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; mode.</p>

<p>```javascript
var http = require(&lsquo;http&rsquo;);</p>

<p>var responseHandler = function(response) {
  if (response.headers.location) {</p>

<pre><code>http.get(response.headers.location, responseHandler);
response.resume();
</code></pre>

<p>  } else {</p>

<pre><code>response.pipe(process.stdout);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
};</p>

<p>http.get(process.argv[2], responseHandler);
```</p>

<p>Notice on line 6 how I&rsquo;ve called response.resume().
This switches the response stream to &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; mode.
According to the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_resume">streams documentation</a>,
this is the way to finish a stream if you don&rsquo;t care about consuming its data.</p>
